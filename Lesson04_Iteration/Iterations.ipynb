    "    - prompt the user \"Which direction would you like to travel in? (N, S, E, or W. done to quit)\" and store in a variable called direction\n",

    "    - If their response is 'done' break out of the loop.\n",
    "3. Tell the user their location \n",

    "## Phase 2: treasure\n",

    "2. In the while loop, after the user's location has been updated, if they are in the same location as the treasure, congratulate them and break out of the loop.\n",

    "3. Tell the user how far they walked d = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) **Hint** check the math module\n",
    "4. You should probably make number 3 a function called distance that takes four parameters (x1, x2, y1, y2) and returns the distance.\n",
    "5. Now that you have your distance formula see if you can make your program say 'warmer' or 'colder' depending on if their distance is closer or further from the treasure than last time (remember to store the last time).\n",
    "6. You might want to add some error checking for if the user say something besides N, S, E, W, or done. "
